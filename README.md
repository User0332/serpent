# Serpent-CLI

Serpent is an easy-to-use templating tool and dependency manager for Python projects, aiming to mimic some of the behavior of the dotnet CLI.

## Installation

Install Serpent using pip: `pip install serpent-cli` OR install it straight from the repository: `pip install git+https://github.com/User0332/serpent`

## Creating/Running Projects

To create a project using serpent, run `serpent new <templatename>` in an empty directory. Serpent will set up a venv, use flit to set up `pyproject.toml`, create a `serpent.conf` file, and use the template package to set up necessary files for the project. To run the project, type `serpent run` into your terminal. For a list of templates, see the [docs]().
